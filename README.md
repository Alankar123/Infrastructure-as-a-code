# Infrastructure-as-Code Projects

This repository contains isolated examples of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) implementations using Terraform and Docker.

- Terraform: Provisions an AWS EC2 instance using input variables and provider configuration.
- Docker: Builds a custom Docker image using Alpine Linux as the base image.

Each folder includes its own README with build and run instructions.
